Is there a proper way to charge and extend the lifetime of your smartphone's battery? 
Should we charge it to 100%, or is it just a myth? Shall we use turbo-chargers? 
Shall we get it to Zero (0) before recharging?

Your smartphone is a minor miracle, a pocket-sized computer that can fulfill almost every whim. 
But none of its superpowers matter a bit if it runs out of juice. With removable batteries becoming 
more and more rare, you've got to take good care of the one you got. Fortunately, it's not to hard keep 
the lithium-ion powering your everything-machine happy if you follow a few simple rules.

Obviously, the first rule for extending your battery life is not using up all your battery life playing 
Candy Crush and walking around with Wi-Fi and GPS enabled when you're not using either and really, really 
need your phone to last that extra hour. But aside from that, there are some basic rules for care and charging, 
and they're the simplest baseline for a healthy battery.

To get the most out of a lithium-ion battery, you should try to keep it north of 50 percent as much as possible. 
For the most part, going from all the way full to all the way empty won't help; in fact, it'll do a little damage 
if you do it too often. That said, it's smart to do one full discharge about once a month for "calibration," but don't 
do it all the time. Running the whole gamut on a regular basis won't make your battery explode or anything, but it will 
shorten its lifespan.

But! You don't want to have battery charging constantly either; lithium-ion batteries can get overheated. Luckily for you, 
your charger is smart enough to help with this, and will cut your phone off for a spell once it's full. And to complicate 
matters a even further, your battery doesn't particularly like being all the way full either. In fact, your battery will 
behave the best if you take it off the charge before it hits 100 percent, and leaving it plugged when it's already full is 
going to cause a little degradation.

So if you're really particular about optimizing your battery's life, you should try to go from around 40 percent to around 
80 percent in one go, and then back down whenever possible. A bunch of tiny charges throughout the day is your second best bet, 
and going from zero to 100 and then 100 to zero on a regular basis will put the most strain on your lithium-ion battery. 

###Never go to zero

If you're going to be shelving any lithium-ion battery for a long time, try to leave it with at least 40 percent battery 
power to tide it over. Lithium-ion batteries don't hemorrhage power when their not in use, but they'll lose maybe five to ten 
percent of their charge each month.

And when lithium-ion batteries get too low—like, literally zero percent—they get seriously unstable, and dangerous to charge. 
To prevent explosion-type disasters when you go to charge one that's been sitting around for a month or two, lithium-ion batteries 
have built-in self-destruct circuits that will disable (read: destroy) the battery for good, if it reaches rock bottom. And sure, 
that'll save you from a face full of battery-acid, but it'll also leave you short one battery.
