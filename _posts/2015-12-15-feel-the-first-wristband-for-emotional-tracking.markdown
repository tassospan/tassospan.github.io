##FEEL from Naxos
It is the first Wristband (wearable) which does *ONE* thing more and few less than the rest of the _World's Wristbands_. 
It does not show you the time, nor the number of steps you have walked, not even our Heart pulse!

_So is it worthy all in all? And for what?_

Emotional awareness is key to leading a happier and more fulfilling life. Recognizing our stress triggers and the factors 
that affect our mood is the first step in managing stress and improving well-being

###Feel the wristband
4 integrated sensors on the wristband measure and track biosignals from users throughout the day, including 
galvanic skin response, blood volume pulse and skin temperature. The buckle on the top of the wristband hides
a flexible connection which ensures that the bracelet stays stable on the wrist. Starting from the classic 
black color, the leather wristband is going to be produced in a variety of colors to satisfy the most demanding 
users.

###Feel the app
The modern leather wristband communicates directly with the user's mobile phone using Bluetooth. The mobile 
application visualizes the results to show users how they feel during the day and how their mood is affected 
by factors such as their activity, the people they meet, as well as the environmental conditions. The app also 
provides personalized recommendations to help users reduce stress and improve well-being.
