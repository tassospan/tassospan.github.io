##Secrets of Crete
Explore the influence of the Minoans, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Venetians and Ottomans on the Greek island of Crete. 
Led by Dr Konstantine Politis, a Greek archaeologist and scholar, the nine-day tour includes special access to the 
INSTAP study centre at the Minoan town of Gournia, a private tour of the archaeological site of Eleftherna which is 
still under excavation and closed to the public, and an exclusive visit to Villa Ariadne at Knossos, once home to 
British archaeologists. Other highlights include visits to the Archaeological Museum in Heraklion, the Minoan palace 
of Phaestos and the convent of Agia Irini where you will enjoy a private guided tour with a nun.

##Church of St John the Baptist in Turkey
Lesser-known than the churches of Cappadocia’s cave-studded Göreme, this frescoed, fifth-century Christian chapel 
in nearby Cavusin is set in a remote hilltop village largely abandoned since the Greece-Turkey population exchanges 
of the 1920s.
